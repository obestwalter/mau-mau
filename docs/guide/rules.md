# Rules

## Basics

>  The game is played with a regular deck of playing cards. The players are dealt each a hand of cards (usually 5). The rest are placed face down as the drawing stack. At the beginning of the game the topmost card is revealed, then the players each get a turn to play cards.

> One can play a card if it corresponds to the suit or value of the open card. E.g. on a 10 of spades, only other spades can be played or other 10s. If a player is not able to, they draw one card from the stack. If he can play this card, he may do so, otherwise he keeps the drawn card and passes his turn. If the drawing stack is empty, the playing stack (except for the topmost card) is shuffled and turned over to serve as new drawing stack.

## Common additions

In addition, the three most common rules are implemented:

* If an eight is played, the next player is skipped
* If a seven is played, the next player has to draw two cards. The next player can put another seven down and instead the following player will have to draw four cards (and so on).
* A Jack can can be put on anything and the player who played it can ask for a different suite to be played
